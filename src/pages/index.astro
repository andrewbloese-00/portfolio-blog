					<h2>About Me </h2>
					<p> I studied computer science at Arizona State University which has equipped me with a solid understanding of programming and data structures. I fell in love with Web Development from my first exposure to it in High School in a Computer Science Principles course. Since then I have learned how to build backends with NodeJS and Python as well as utilize HTML, CSS and Javascript to build interactive and responsive front-ends. I have recently started learning  Go, and can't wait to see what I can build with it. I welcome you to check out my <a href="#projects">projects</a> below or on my <a href="https://github.com/andrewbloese-00">Github</a>
