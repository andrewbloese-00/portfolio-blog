## The Goal: 
The client asked for a simple soundboard website with dynamic sound blocks that they can reorder, edit, delete and hide.  

## The Execution:  
This application uses vanilla javascript to accomplish all of the tasks, which helped keep the performance score high (compared to using frameworks like react). The application is connected to firebase firestore, authentication and storage, which enabled the client to dynamically change content from within a secure admin dashboard page.   

Appropriate "toast" style notifications when interacting with forms on the website also help the website feel more responsive.

## Overall: 
This was definitely a fun project, and helped me understand that you don't need to use a framework to build a performant and dynamic web application.
